# CLEANER_42_IMPROVED

CLEAN++ is based on cclean but its improved.

First of all, git clone this bash script and use these commands in the directory where you git cloned Clean++.

`chmod 777 cleaner.sh`

`./cleaner.sh install`

Second, `exit` your terminal and launch it again.

Now you can use this new cleaner by using the `clean++` command wherever you want in your mac !

Thank you, enjoy !
