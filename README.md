# CLEANER_42_IMPROVED

CLEAN++ is based on cclean but its improved.


First of all, use these commands :

`https://github.com/AchelDrinker/CLEANER_42_IMPROVED.git`

`chmod 777 cleaner.sh`

`./cleaner.sh install`


Second, `exit` your terminal and launch it again.


Now you can use this new cleaner by using the `clean++` command wherever you want in your mac !
