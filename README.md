# CLEANER_42_IMPROVED

CLEAN++ is based on cclean but its improved.

First of all, use this command :

`git clone https://github.com/AchelDrinker/CLEANER_42_IMPROVED.git clean++ && cd clean++ && chmod 777 cleaner.sh && ./cleaner.sh install`

Second, `exit` your terminal and launch it again.

Now you can use this new cleaner by using the `clean++` command wherever you want in your mac !
You can choose if you wanna use brew cleanup.
Brew cleanup frees up space in macOS and Linux devices by removing old versions of formulae and small kegs of data.

Thank you, enjoy !
