# CLEANER_42_IMPROVED

CLEAN++ is based on cclean but its improved.

First of all, use this command :

`git clone https://github.com/AchelDrinker/CLEANER_42_IMPROVED.git clean++ && cd clean++ && chmod 777 cleaner.sh && ./cleaner.sh install`

Second, `exit` your terminal and launch it again.

Now you can use this new cleaner by using the `clean++` command wherever you want in your mac !

Thank you, enjoy !
